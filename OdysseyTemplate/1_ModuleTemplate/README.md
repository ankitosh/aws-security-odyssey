# AWS Security Odyssey - Title

# Module 1 - Sample Module

### Overview

Add the narrative and context describing how this module fits into the flow of the overall workshop / bootcamp.

Provide a high level overview of the module and what will be learned / accomplished.

The module walks you through the process of creating alerts for one such event using AWS Console. Steps for the rest of the events have been automated in a CloudFormation template, which is provided to you.

The module makes use of a number of AWS services namely AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudTrail, AWS CloudWatch Alarms,  AWS CloudFormation and others.

### Topics Covered

After completing this module, you should be able to automate notifications for any of the below use cases:
- Amazon S3 Bucket Activity
- Security Group Configuration Changes
- Network Access Control List (ACL) Changes
- Network Gateway Changes
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Changes
- Amazon EC2 Instance Changes
- CloudTrail Changes
- Console Sign-In Failures
- Authorization Failures
- IAM Policy Changes

### Prerequisites

This module is targeted for IT security focused individuals who are interested in learning about automating security related events on AWS. You will need an AWS account with administrators access.

To successfully complete this module, you should be familiar with AWS services including Amazon EC2, S3, VPC etc. and have a basic understanding of security groups, Network Access Control List (NACL), IAM Policies etc. You should be comfortable logging into and using the AWS Management Console and have familiarity with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

### 1. Select a Region and Launch CloudFormation Stack

**Tip** The AWS region name is always listed in the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, in the navigation bar.

Make a note of the AWS *region name*, for example, *US West (Oregon),*

For more information about regions, see: [AWS Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)

**Note** If needed, create a new key pair: [Creating a Key Pair Using Amazon EC2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair)
